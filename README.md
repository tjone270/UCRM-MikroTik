# UCRM-MikroTik

Plugins are open-source programs that extend the functionality of [UCRM](https://ucrm.ubnt.com/). 

## How does it work?
* [Find the plugin](https://github.com/tjone270/UCRM-MikroTik/tree/master/plugins) you need and download its ZIP archive.
* Upload the ZIP archive in UCRM (System > Plugins).
* Then, enable the plugin and configure its settings.
* That's it, let UCRM run the plugin repeatedly or click to execute it on demand.
